# TryHackMe SOC Analyst Labs

This repository contains my hands-on investigations, packet analysis notes, and threat-hunting workflows from various TryHackMe rooms related to SOC analyst work.

Each write-up follows a consistent structure:
- Objective  
- Approach  
- Analysis  
- Final Answers  
- Key takeaways relevant to real SOC workflows  

This repository is continuously being developed. Additional rooms, notes, and improvements will be added as I make progress through the SOC Analyst learning path.
